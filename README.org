* DEPRECATION NOTICE

=anything-project-files= has been superseded by [[https://github.com/lewang/helm-cmd-t][lewang/helm-cmd-t]].  This project will not be developed further.

** Purpose

1. Anything source for files in current project.
2. "C-x b" replacement.

** Install

see header of source.
** But what about flex?

I don't like flex.  It often returns results I didn't intend. It needs other [[http://scottfrazersblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/emacs-better-ido-flex-matching.html][optimizations]] to be useful.

Anything's space separated regexps require a few more keystrokes, but the results are consistent and predictable.  See the header of anything-match-plugin.el for details.
